## History

Once upon a time in the distant land of 2021, two brilliant developers (let's call them EMPTY and Mrinmoy) had a brilliant idea: why not create yet another programming language when there are already a gazillion out there? They thought, "Hey, why not make things even more confusing for aspiring programmers by adding another language to the mix?" And thus, the idea for Swirl was born.

Then, two more brave souls (Eight and Dart) joined the bandwagon, because, you know, why not?(actually Dart made the language possible) And after a grueling few months(1.5 years) of coding and testing, they released the first alpha version of Swirl in November of 2022.

But let's be real here, why settle for just another programming language when you can have Swirl? I mean, what's the point of choosing simplicity and efficiency when you can have...Swirl! (i am joking. Swirl is not simple by any means)


:::tip Fun fact

Swirl was named Lambda Code before.
