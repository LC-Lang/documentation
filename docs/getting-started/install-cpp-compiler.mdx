A C++ compiler is required to compile swirl programs. Because we convert our swirl programs to c++ programs and that needs to be compiled down into machine code.

For Swirl a C++ 20 compiler is required.

## Linux

C++ compilers come preinstalled on most of the linux distros. But if its not follow the tutorial.

### Ubuntu/Debian

```shell
sudo apt install g++
```

### Fedora

```shell
sudo dnf install gcc
```

### Arch Linux

```shell
sudo pacman -S gcc
```

After installing the C++ compiler, you can verify the installation by checking the version number:

```shell
g++ --version
```

## Windows

We recommend [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/), [Clang](https://clang.llvm.org/) for Linux and macOS,
and [tdm-gcc](https://jmeubank.github.io/tdm-gcc/), [Mingw-W64](https://mingw-w64.org/) for Windows.
