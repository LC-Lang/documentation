This guide will help you get started with the Swirl programming language.

## Installation

Before getting started make sure Swirl is installed in your system. Follow the [installation](installation.mdx) guide for more info.

After installing Swirl make sure its working properly by running
```shell
swirl --version
```

You are now ready to create your first swirl program.

### Write a program

Create a new Swirl file and save it with the **.sw** or **.swirl** extension. For example, **hello.sw**.

Then write the following or you can write your own.

```sw title="hello.sw"
//  This is a comment in Swirl
func sayHello(string name) {
  print("Hello, " + name + "!")
}

// Call the sayHello function
sayHello("world")
```

This is a simple Swirl program that defines a function called **sayHello**, which takes a single parameter of type **string**. The function then prints the message "Hello, " followed by the value of the **name** parameter, followed by an exclamation mark.

After defining the **sayHello** function, the code then calls this function, passing in the string **"world"** as the argument. When the program is run, the output on the console will be "Hello, world!".

Overall, this code serves as a basic example of how to define functions and pass parameters in Swirl. For a more in depth tutorial check the [Swirl tour](../swirl-tour).

### Compilation
Run the following commands to compile and run the program.

```shell
swirl hello.sw --run
```

It will compile and run the program.

If everything worked correctly it should output `Hello, world!`.

Congrats you've made your first Swirl app.

Check out the [Swirl Tour](../swirl-tour), for a introduction to the most important concepts and features of the language.


To fully utilize the power of Swirl and enhance your programming experience, setting up a development environment is a crucial next step. For detailed instructions, refer to our guide on Setting up a [Development Environment](dev-env-setup.mdx).
